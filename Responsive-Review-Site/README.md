# Responsive Review Site
 
 This Project is to demonstrate the skills i've learned in this beginner web design class to create a fully functional and responsive website for a fictional business.

 This Project contains  HTML, CSS, responsive design principles, usability standards, SEO practices, and basic JavaScript that I have learned over the year from in class and outside sources.


## Purpose & Challenge Faced
The Purpose of this site is to display my ability to use what I have learned in and out of class in website form. For this project I wanted to explore a bit more of JavaScript, and CSS and HTML formating. With this came challenges with how I wanted to format each page, the color selection, and overall styling of the website.


## Design Choices

For design choices I tried to keep the website looking as simple and clean as possible. A home page that leads the user into the site with its simplicity. Every page was created with the mindset of subtracting rather than adding. I am happy with the outcome of my design choices.
