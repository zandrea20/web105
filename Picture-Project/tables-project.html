                    <h2>Tables pt. 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this other HTML project, I had to work with tables to make a time management tool featuring a calendar and a schedule differentiated between weekdays and weekends. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This furthered my learning on how to structure and style tables using HTML and CSS, an important step in improving my web design skills. I learned to make the data neat and presentable with the "table", "tr", "td", and "th" tags, while creating rows and columns. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was quite an important skill when building layouts that deal with structured information, like calendars, plans, and price lists. Along with the structure in HTML, CSS was introduced to me for styling the tables. I implemented several visual enhancements, such as border, padding, background-color, and text-align. 
                    </p>
                
            </div>
        

      
            <div class="container-2">
                
                    <img src="img/Table2.png" alt="Table2">
                
                
                    <h2>Tables pt. 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the main challenges of this project was how to highlight which day is a weekday or a weekend.  Being able to use two different colored backgrounds for the weekend and weekday makes the readability of the schedule much easier for any end user. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the key challenges in this project was learning how to differentiate weekdays from weekends. 
                    </p>
                
            </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="container-2 right"> 
            <img src="img/Table3.png" alt="Table3">
            <h2>Tables pt. 3</h2>
            <p>
                I used different background colors for weekends and weekdays, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning how to work with tables in CSS opened many new ways of creating nice, functional layouts that could be used in various purposes, such as calendars, schedules, and data-driven designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully with future developments in my HTML and CSS skills I can creaste an easier and more user-friendly version of the calander.

                This Project along with the others you have seen on this page have given me the skills to create a web page for my first big project which is located on the next page. 
            <p>
            <p>
                With future tables I would like to learn how to allow the user to select certain cells and add their own date times and events. Creating a easy to use system for our end user would be exciting to learn.
