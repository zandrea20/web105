        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>
            My most recent project was on CSS grids combined with basic JavaScript in making an interactive image gallery. This marked the important milestone of my learning because it introduced me to CSS Grid in designing layouts and basic interactivity with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started off designing a responsive and flexible grid of images organized into neat rows and columns, one after the other, using CSS Grid. In this way, I can show many images on the page with an organized look that will be sure to adapt quite well with changing screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most exciting part of this project was to make the gallery interactive using JavaScript. I used the JavaScript method of getting an element by its ID, getElementById(), to allow any of these images in this grid to be clicked on and change the main image display to that image which was clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used classes as a way to control these image elements, enabling the main image to change dynamically according to user actions. This was a pretty simple but effective function, which enhanced the user experience by enabling a far more engaging and interactive web page.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project taught me how to merge HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to bring about interactivity. It also gave me an understanding of how the application of different web technologies together can bring about functional and user-friendly designs.
