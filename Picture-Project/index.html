                <p>In my first project, I worked on the basics of HTML. This project made me comprehend the basic structure of web pages just by working with simple tags of HTML.</p>

                <p>I used the "h1", "h2", and "h3" tags for headings at different levels, "p"  tags for paragraphs, and the img tag for displaying images, apart from providing an embedded link to the user, directing them to an external website, with the help of the "a" tag.</p>
        
                <p>This project had very minimal styling and was purely aimed at creating a well-structured webpage using raw HTML. This gave me a solid grasp of organizing content and presenting that to viewers.</p>
        
                <p>Although design or styling was not on the table at this point, it was an essential stepping stone in my path toward web development.</p>

    <h2>Second Project</h2>
    <div class="container-2">
        <div class="img-text-wrapper">
            
                <div class="img-left">
                    <img src="img/starterproj2.png" alt="starter2">
                </div>
            <div class="text-right">
                <p>My second project was a video game review page, and it represented my first real dive into the actual CSS styling. I began to dabble in making my webpage look more visually appealing with the adjustment of background colors, text colors, font sizes, and text alignment.</p>

                <p>This project introduced me to typography control: font families, weights, and sizes were set to improve readability and aesthetics. I also used HTML tags such as "b" to make text bold, "em" to emphasize text, and "small" to make text small to give the content some variation and structure.</p>

                <p>These different ways of styling and laying out information were key in learning how to make my webpage functional and visually appealing. This project laid the groundwork for my understanding of HTML and CSS and gave me skills that I've been building on to this day.</p>
